## A Deep Q-Learning Approach to Solve Sudoku Puzzles

Our Final Project code 

Note: since the CSV file has 1 million values it cannot be pushed into the repo here so below is the link to Kaggle from where we took the dataset

[Click here to download the dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bryanpark/sudoku)

Make sure to rename the .csv file to "sudoku" if you are running in the Google Colab

## How to run 

If you are running in Google Colab make sure to download the .csv file and then copy and paste each file content to a different cell and then Run All 
The order in which the code was implemented -
1. SudokuBoard.py
2. CustomDeepQNetwork.py
3. RunGame.py

The RunGame.py is the main file that must be at the end. This file runs the entire project.
